# Weather App

The Weather App is a web application that provides users with real-time weather information based on their location. The app displays a simple description of the weather, the user's location, and the temperature in degrees. The Weather App is built using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages the Open Weather API and Navigation API in the browser to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information.

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Develop a web application that provides users with real-time weather information based on their location.
- Learn how to use external APIs, such as the Open Weather API, to fetch weather data and display it in the app.
- Learn how to use the Navigation API in the browser to obtain the user's location and use it to provide location-specific weather information.
- Learn how to use Leaflet, a popular open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, to display a map of the user's location.

## Key Features

The weather app offers the following key features:

- Real-time weather information: The app provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information based on their location, including a simple description of the weather, the user's location, and the temperature in degrees.
